### The Coordinator Pattern

The idea behind the Coordinator pattern is the creation of a separate entity &mdash; __*a Coordinator object*__ &mdash; which is responsible for the application’s *flow.*

*So what is a coordinator?*

>
> A **coordinator** is an object that bosses one or more view controllers around.
>
> A **coordinator** is an object that encapsulates a lifecycle that is spread over a collection of view controllers.
>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Source:* [Coordinators Redux](http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/) &mdash; Soroush Khanlou<sup>1</sup>


The Coordinator encapsulates a part of the application. A Coordinator knows nothing of its parent Coordinator, but it can start its child Coordinators.

Similar to how UIViewControllers manage UIViews, Coordinators can manage UIViewControllers taking all of the driving logic (navigation) out of view controllers and moving it up one level &mdash; to a __*Coordinator layer.*__

https://medium.com/@saad.eloulladi/ios-coordinator-pattern-in-swift-39a15aa3b01b




### Problems Addressed

Most of the challenges the Coordinator pattern addresses are related to the limitations of how View Controllers are designed to work within standard MVC.

Key issues the Coordinator pattern can potentially resolve are...

1. **The Pushing Problem**

One of the standard ways to perform navigation on iOS is to use a `UINavigationController` onto which each view controller can either pop or push other view controllers.

Most iOS developers have implemented this type of navigation a hundred or more times:

```Swift
if let vc = storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "SomeVC") {
    navigationController?.pushViewController(vc, animated: true)
}
```
__*The Problem*__

When the view controllers themselves must decide the next view controller to push onto `self.navigationController`,
the View controllers are too tightly coupled.

As an app grows, this approach becomes difficult to deal with: The codebase will be hard to change and maintain, and view controllers are almost impossible to reuse.

What if...
- you need to be able to navigate to the same view controller from multiple places?
- you want to implement something like deep linking from outside your app?

<!--
```Swift
class ImageListViewController: UITableViewController {
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
                            didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
        let image = images[indexPath.row]
        let detailVC = ImageDetailViewController(image: image)
        navigationController?.pushViewController(detailVC, animated: true)
    }
}
```

```Swift
class MyViewController : UIViewController {

    // ...
    @IBAction func didTap(_ button: Any) {

        let newViewController = NextViewController()
        self.navigationController?.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
    }
}
``` -->

2. **Massive View Controller Problem** &mdash; (see previous lesson for description and example)

3. **Reusability** &mdash; with standard MVC, View Controllers are nearly impossible to reuse, especially if overloaded with non-VC tasks.

4. **Tight Coupling** &mdash; an inflexible design in which every controller needs to know details about other controllers inhibits an app's growth.

5. **Deep Linking Issues** &mdash; *(see Coordinators and Deep Linking section)*

6. **Testing** &mdash; if you want to generate different views or a different flow in response to user choices (A/B testing) or to handle layout variations, standard MVC implementations of VCs make it extremely difficult to test those scenarios.  


### Implementation Notes

A solid, basic implementation of coordinators includes 3 main steps:
1. Design two protocols:
- __*Coordinator Protocol*__ - To be used by all our coordinators.
- __*View Controller Creation Protocol*__ - To facilitate view controller creation.
2. Create a __*main coordinator*__ that will control app flow. Start it when your app launches.
3. Create/present view controllers.

**About the Coordinator Protocol**

All coordinators will conform to this protocol. At bare minimum, it should include:
- A property to store any child coordinators. Coordinator responsibility is to handle navigation flow: the same way that UINavigationController keeps reference of its stack, Coordinators do the same with their children.
- A property to store the navigation controller being used to present view controllers. (Even if you don’t show the navigation bar at the top, using a navigation controller is the easiest way to present view controllers.)
- A `start()` function to make the coordinator take control. This allows us to create a coordinator fully and activate it only when we’re ready.


<!-- TODO: Need to get an example of this  -->

#### Example:

*The code below is for illustration only &mdash; IT WILL NOT run in a playground!*

This example code illustrates basic implementation steps of the Coordinator pattern when intended for use as a an application-wide navigation strategy.

1. Coordinator protocol created, keeping a reference (an array property) to all of its *children:*

```Swift
protocol Coordinator : class {
    var childCoordinators : [Coordinator] { get set }
    func start()
}
```

2. For building the user flow, a concrete implementation of the protocol is created:

```Swift
class BaseCoordinator : Coordinator {
    var childCoordinators : [Coordinator] = []

    func start() {
        fatalError("Children should implement `start`.")
    }
}
```

3. The View Controller Creation protocol is created:

```Swift
  protocol ControllerCreator {
      static func instantiate() -> Self
  }
```

4. All view controllers targeted for participation in the coordinated navigation approach must:
- Conform to the `ControllerCreator` protocol
- Have a `BaseCoordinator` property for access to its properties and functions

```Swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, ControllerCreator {

     weak var coordinator: BaseCoordinator?

     ...
```

5. If an application-wide navigation strategy, then the `AppDelegate` will need:
- a `BaseCoordinator` property
- an application-wide association between its `BaseCoordinator` property and an instance of `UINavigationController` in its `application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` function


## In Class Activity I (25 min)

### Individually

**Required Resources:**
1. Download the starter app: [iOS-CoordinatorsActivity1_B](https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/iOS-CoordinatorsActivity1_B)

**Background:**

The `iOS-CoordinatorsActivity1_B` app is incomplete.

Instead of pushing and presenting ViewControllers from other view controllers, the app seeks to implement the Coordinator pattern.

When completed, all screen navigation will be managed by coordinators.

Currently, the app contains implementations of two protocols for:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The Coordinator procol - for navigation </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The Storyboarded protocol - for dynamically instantiating View Controller objects from the Main Storyboard bundle </br>

__*Navigation Protocol*__
```Swift
protocol Coordinator {
    var childCoordinators: [Coordinator] { get set }
    var navigationController: UINavigationController { get set }

    func start()
}
```

__*VC Creation Protocol*__

```Swift
protocol Storyboarded {
    static func instantiate() -> Self
}
```

__*Note that:*__
- the main VC (`ViewController`) is __*not*__ configured as the "Initial View Controller" in the storyboad
- in order to be created dynamically, all VCs are given a `StoryBoard ID`

**- TODO -** </br>
The code in the app is nearly complete. Your job is to:
- analyze the app's structure wrt how it is creating view controllers
- complete any missing code so that the `BuyViewController` and `CreateAccountViewController` are presented using the Coordinator pattern instead of typical iOS navigation process (*see* The Pushing Problem *above*)


> **TIP:** Look for the //TODO: annotations we left in the app for you...

## Overview/TT II (15 min)

### Benefits

Coordinators are very easy to use and implement. They can have huge impact on cleaning the code base and on making view controllers more loosely coupled from each other.

The pattern can be adopted for only part of an app or used across the entire application.

Coordinators create a well defined way to deal with navigation in which view controllers are:
1. Isolated from each other (do not need to know about each other)
2. Reusable in different contexts
3. Lightweight, less "massive," and focused on their key responsibilities

And they can provide the ability to organize an application's architecture by use case scenarios.

### Pitfalls

The downside of the Coordinator pattern:

1. **Back Button Issue** &mdash; When the user navigates back, developers must ensure that the right coordinator is released. Solutions for this might come with potential loss of built-in framework features.

2. **Overkill** &mdash; The pattern could well take too much work for very simple apps. Many extra classes will need to be created upfront.

### When to Use

Coordinators are especially useful for complex apps with a large number of destinations screens that can be reached (presented) from multiple places.

### Coordinator Types

Coordinators can be created for a variety of purposes.

Most often, Coordinators are used for:

- navigation flow
- managing changes to the Model

**AppCoordinator**

Creating an app-wide `AppCoordinator` is the most common implementation of Coordinators for navigation flow. This requires one high-level coordinator instantiated in the `AppDelegate` that directs navigation for the whole app (also known as the *Application Controller pattern*<sup>2</sup>)

The `AppCoordinator` holds an array of child coordinators, who in turn might hold an array of their own child coordinators.

This is especially useful in a TabBar app: each TabBar scene's navigation controller could get its own coordinator for directing its own behavior and flow. And each coordinator can be spawned by its parent coordinator.

In addition, child coordinators can be created for specific tasks like signing up or creating content.

> **TIP:** Remember to employ the Coordinator pattern early in your development process so child coordinators can be useful even in single-step tasks (such as authentication).

### Coordinator and Deep Linking

A **deep link** is any link that directs a user past the home page of a website or app to content inside of it:
- for example, linking directly to a product instead of the home page.

**iOS and Deep Linking**
For many kinds of apps we not only want to make it easy to navigate within our own app, but also to enable other apps and websites to deep link into ours.

A common way to do this on iOS is to define a URL scheme that other apps can then use to link directly into a specific screen or feature of an app.

__*The Obstacle*__

To support deep linking in an iOS app, you might need to open specific views in the app, regardless of the navigation history or navigation design.

With standard MVC and its potential to tightly-couple View Controllers, it is very difficult to implement deep linking.

__*The Solution*__

Using Coordinators and navigator objects, implementing URL and deep linking support becomes a lot easier because it allows for dedicated navigation points in which URL handling logic can be injected.

<!-- this needs some example TODO: research this more -->

### Coordinator &mdash; with Other Patterns

Coordinator is an easy pattern to implement with other complementary patterns.

For examples:
1. __*Coordinator with MVVM*__
- MVVM results in thinner VCs, more easily testable code, and data formatting logic that is decoupled from VCs.
- Adding navigation flow coordinators further decouples VCs
2. __*Coordinator with Factory*__
- Combines more flexible navigation with the ability to create objects (even View Controllers) on demand and to dynamically customized specifications.
