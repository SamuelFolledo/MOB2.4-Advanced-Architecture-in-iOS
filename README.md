# [MOB2.4 - Advanced Architecture in iOS](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-2.4-Advanced-Architectural-Patterns-in-iOS)

Advanced iOS development course at [Make School](makeshcool.com) about architectural patterns that will help build rock solid iOS apps. This course covered architectural paradigms and dove deep into a cutting edge iOS patterns like Functional Programming & Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).

## Learning Outcomes
Students by the end of the course will be able to ‚Ä¶

1. Analyze and apply different creational, behavioral and structural patterns.
2. Implement MVVM, Coordinators as architectural patterns.
3. Use functional programming in Swift.
4. Evaluate when to implement Reactive Programming in their projects.

### 5. [MVVM]()

### 6. [Coordinators]()

### 7. [Functional Programming part 1]()

### 8. [Functional Programming part 2]()

### 9. Lab Day

### 10. [Combine part 1]()
- Publishers
- Subscribers
    - Built-in Subscribers //18:45m
        - [Assign](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/#reference-assign)¬†- let‚Äôs us¬†**bind**¬†the result to some property in our model or on a UI control via a key path.
        - [Sink](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/#reference-sink)¬†- let‚Äôs us pass closures and completion handlers (you can do anything here üòé)
    - A subscriber activates the publisher. Note that publishers won‚Äôt emit values if there are no subscribers.
- Operators
    - An object that acts both like a subscriber and a publisher
    - Classes that adopt both the Subscriber protocol and Publisher protocol
    - They support subscribing to a publisher, and sending results to any subscribers
    - Can be chained to process, transform data

### 11. [Combine part 2]()
- Subject
    - A publisher that exposes a method for outside callers to publish elements
        - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subject
    - A special case of publisher that also follows the¬†Subject protocol.
    - Lets you inject values in a stream by calling a¬†send¬†method.
    - `func¬†send()`
        - Sends a void value to the subscriber.
    - A way of emitting a single value whenever you say so.
    - Subjects can act as a conductor to send values from non-Combine imperative code to Combine subscribers.

- Built-in Subjects //24m
    - üö™üõé¬†[PassthroughSubject](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/#reference-passthroughsubject)‚Ä®- Let's you publish new values on demand. They will pass along values and a completion event.
    - üè†üí°¬†[CurrentValueSubject](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/#reference-currentvaluesubject) - Lets you look at the current value of a publisher.‚Ä®
    - [Analogy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60482737/what-is-passthroughsubject-currentvaluesubject)
        - PassthroughSubject: When someone rings the door, you are notified if you are at home (you are the subscriber)
        - CurrentValueSubject: If someone turns on the lights in your house when you are out, when you get back you'll find them turned on.
- Playground Demo
    - PassthroughSubject
    - CurrentValueSubject

### 12. [Combine with UIKit]()
- [`@Published`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/published) - A type that publishes a property marked with an attribute.
`@propertyWrapper struct Published<Value>`
    - Publishing a property with the @Published attribute creates a publisher of this type.
    - You access the publisher with the $ operator
    - Class constrained
