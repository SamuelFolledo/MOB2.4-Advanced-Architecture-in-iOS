# [MOB2.4 - Advanced Architecture in iOS](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-2.4-Advanced-Architectural-Patterns-in-iOS)

Advanced iOS development course at [Make School](makeshcool.com) about architectural patterns that will help build rock solid iOS apps. This course covered architectural paradigms and dove deep into a cutting edge iOS patterns like Functional Programming & Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).

## Learning Outcomes
Students by the end of the course will be able to â€¦

1. Analyze and apply different creational, behavioral and structural patterns.
2. Implement MVVM, Coordinators as architectural patterns.
3. Use functional programming in Swift.
4. Evaluate when to implement Reactive Programming in their projects.
